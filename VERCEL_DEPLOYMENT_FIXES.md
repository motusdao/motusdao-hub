# Vercel Deployment Fixes - Balance Reading & Pimlico API Key

## Issues Identified

### 1. Balance Reading Section Not Deployed
**Status**: ✅ Code exists and is ready for deployment

The balance reading functionality is already implemented in:
- `app/pagos/page.tsx` - UI component with balance display
- `lib/balances.ts` - Balance fetching logic using `getAllTokenBalances()`

The section includes:
- Total balance display
- Per-token balance list
- Token selection for detailed view
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh button

**Action Required**: Commit and deploy the changes to Vercel.

### 2. Pimlico API Key 401 Unauthorized Error
**Status**: ✅ Error handling improved

**Root Cause**: The `PIMLICO_API_KEY` environment variable is either:
- Not set in Vercel
- Incorrect/expired
- Missing access to Celo Mainnet (chain 42220)

**Fixes Applied**:
1. ✅ Improved error messages in `/api/pimlico/bundler/route.ts`
2. ✅ Improved error messages in `/api/pimlico/paymaster/route.ts`
3. ✅ Better error handling in `ZeroDevSmartWalletProvider.tsx`
4. ✅ Added helpful debugging logs

**Error Messages Now Include**:
- Clear indication that API key is missing or invalid
- Instructions to check Vercel environment variables
- Link to Pimlico dashboard for verification
- Specific mention of chain 42220 (Celo Mainnet) requirement

### 3. Wallet Creation Issue
**Status**: ✅ Logic is correct, issue is with paymaster authentication

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ Two wallets are detected (MetaMask + Privy embedded)
- ✅ Smart accounts are created for both wallets
- ❌ Paymaster fails with 401 when trying to use Pimlico

**Root Cause**: The wallet creation works fine, but transactions fail because Pimlico API key authentication fails.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Pimlico API Key in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Verify `PIMLICO_API_KEY` exists and is correct
4. Ensure it's set for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments
5. If missing or incorrect:
   - Get your API key from https://dashboard.pimlico.io
   - Make sure it has access to **Celo Mainnet** (Chain ID: 42220)
   - Add it to Vercel with name: `PIMLICO_API_KEY` (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

### Step 2: Commit and Deploy Changes

```bash
# Check current changes
git status

# Add the improved error handling files
git add app/api/pimlico/bundler/route.ts
git add app/api/pimlico/paymaster/route.ts
git add lib/contexts/ZeroDevSmartWalletProvider.tsx

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Improve Pimlico API key error handling and balance reading deployment"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment, check the browser console. You should see:

**Success Indicators**:
```
[PIMLICO BUNDLER PROXY] ✅ API key found, length: XX
[PIMLICO PAYMASTER PROXY] ✅ API key found, length: XX
[ZERODEV] ✅ Smart account client created: 0x...
[ZERODEV] ✅ Chain ID verified: 42220
```

**Error Indicators** (if API key is still wrong):
```
[PIMLICO BUNDLER PROXY] ❌ 401 Unauthorized - API key may be invalid or expired
[PIMLICO BUNDLER PROXY] 💡 Check: 1) API key is correct in Vercel, 2) API key is active in Pimlico dashboard, 3) API key has access to Celo Mainnet (chain 42220)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see 401 errors:

1. **Verify API Key in Pimlico Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.pimlico.io
   - Check that your API key is active
   - Verify it has access to Celo Mainnet (42220)
   - Check if the key has expired or been rotated

2. **Verify Vercel Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Check that `PIMLICO_API_KEY` is set (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY`)
   - Ensure it's set for the correct environment (Production/Preview/Development)
   - Copy the value and verify it matches your Pimlico dashboard

3. **Redeploy After Changes**:
   - After adding/updating the environment variable, you MUST redeploy
   - Go to Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy latest
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

4. **Check Server Logs**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your deployment
   - Check the function logs for `/api/pimlico/bundler` and `/api/pimlico/paymaster`
   - Look for error messages about API key

### Balance Reading Not Showing:

1. **Verify Smart Wallet is Connected**:
   - The balance reading requires `smartAccountAddress` to be set
   - Check that the ZeroDev provider successfully created the smart wallet
   - Look for: `[ZERODEV] ✅ Smart account client created: 0x...`

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for errors in `getAllTokenBalances()` calls
   - Verify the smart wallet address is correct
   - Check network tab for failed API calls

3. **Verify Code is Deployed**:
   - The balance reading code should be in `app/pagos/page.tsx`
   - Check that the section appears in the UI (around line 650-900)
   - If missing, the code may not be deployed yet

## Summary

✅ **Balance Reading**: Code is ready, just needs to be deployed
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved with better messages and debugging
✅ **Pimlico API Key**: Needs to be verified/configured in Vercel
✅ **Wallet Creation**: Working correctly, issue is only with paymaster authentication

The main action item is to **verify and set the `PIMLICO_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables**, then redeploy.
